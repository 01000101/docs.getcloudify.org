Cloudify's Command-Line Interface is the default method for interacting with Cloudify and managing your applications. It features actions such as uploading blueprints and deleting them, creating deployments, executing workflows and retrieving events (covered in the [CLI reference]({{< relref "cli/reference.md" >}})).

The interface can be accessed by running the `cfy` command. `cfy -h` will get you started.

A full `cfy` commands reference can be found [here](cli-cfy-reference.html).

Note that some features, such as viewing metric graphs and application topologies are only available via the Web UI.
