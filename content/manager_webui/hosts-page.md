# Overview
When clicking on the `Nodes` tab, you will be able to view all the nodes that are related to a `Deployment`:

![Nodes Overview]({{<img "ui/ui-nodes-overview.png">}})

You can control which nodes are displayed by filtering by:

#### Blueprints
See the definition [here](/reference-terminology#blueprint).

![Blueprints]({{<img "ui/ui-nodes-blueprints-selection.png">}})

#### Deployments
See the definition [here](/reference-terminology#deployment).

This list is affected by the selection of blueprints.<br>
If the blueprints selection consists only of undeployed blueprints, this dropdown will not be visible.<br>
Likewise, it will not include a deployment if the blueprint it is based on wasn't selected.<br>
Not selecting any deployments is equivalent to selecting all deployments in the list.

#### Types
See the definition [here](/reference-terminology#type).

![Types]({{<img "ui/ui-nodes-types-selection.png">}})

# Live update
This page is filtered live as you check/uncheck items in dropdowns.

![Show Results]({{<img "ui/ui-nodes-results.png">}})

# Search nodes
This page allows live search of nodes.<br>
As you type in the search box, the items in the nodes list will be updated to reflect the search criteria.

*Note, that all fields of the table are searched*
